Feedback from Part 2:
I need to improve on my Code structure, by making it more logical and easier to understand. Therefore, in this Part I planned what I need to do and how the app must work. By still using the generic collection: list from part 2, I made it as a constructor class to still be accessible in the main window. With this recipes can be stored and accessed. This makes the code neater and organized. I also implemented variable names that makes sense and is linked to each function. Additionally, I added more comments explaining methods. I also implemented clear steps in the window so that users know what to do. (110 words)
